# Abstract
This thesis presents the development of Axo, a new programming language. The work is structured into six chapters, each addressing a distinct aspect of the project. The opening chapter outlines the motivation for creating the language and defines its objectives. Chapter 2 explores the fundamental design principles of Axo, with an emphasis on its similarities to and differences from existing programming languages and tools.

Chapter 3 examines the architecture of the compiler, detailing its design and implementation. This includes a step-by-step explanation of the compilation process, the challenges encountered during development, and the solutions implemented. Chapter 4 provides an evaluation of Axoâ€™s performance, focusing on both compilation speed and runtime efficiency, along with an overview of the built-in testing system.

Finally, Chapter 6 offers a comprehensive summary of the project, reflecting on the achievements, insights gained, and potential directions for future work.
