# Abstract
This paper describes my work on creating a new programming language. It has been structured into 6 different sections, each covering a different aspect of the subject itself. At the start I'll be describing what inspired me to make such project and briefly discuss the objectives. Later, in chapter 2, I'll be talking about basics of the design and similarities it shares with other programming languages and tools. After that one can read about the architecture of the implementation of a compiler that implements this language. Later on, I'll summarize step-by-step what the compiler does and the issues I encountered during implementation as well as how I finally solved them. The next section holds information on the performance of the langauge, both in term of compilation speed and runtime. It will also cover the built-in testing system. Finally, in chapter 6 I'll be presenting my own summary of the whole project which concludes what I have achieved, my regrets and concludes this paper.
The following paper is also published [here](https://www.axolang.com/#/), on my website hosted just for this project.
