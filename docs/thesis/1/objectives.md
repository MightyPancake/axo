# Objectives
The objectives of this thesis are as follows:

## Develop a Blueprint for Axo
Establish a clear design for the language, including its syntax, semantics, and core principles, to ensure its consistency and usability throughout development.

## Implement a Compiler
Create a fully functional compiler for Axo, translating source code into executable machine code with a focus on simplicity, performance, and reliability.

## Assess Language Performance
Evaluate Axo in terms of runtime efficiency and compilation speed, benchmarking it against similar languages to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

## Enhance Accessibility
Build a comprehensive website for Axo, including detailed documentation and a web-based playground for hands-on experimentation.

## Promote Testing and Debugging
Include a built-in testing framework within Axo to improve the developer experience.
