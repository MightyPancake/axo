# Objectives
The motivations discussed in the previous section resulted in setting the main objectives of the language itself, but first let's talk about the objectives of the whole project.

## Design
The first objective is obviously just the design phase; making sure what will be implemented actually has a blueprint which makes sense. This needs to be done carefully as making changes to the design mid-developement costs a lot of time and effort.

## Compiler
After the design is done the language needs an implementation. Therefore it needs either a compiler or an interpreter. I decided to go for the second option here, mainly because I have done my fair share of interpreters before and it also matches the goal of making a simpler to use C better.
