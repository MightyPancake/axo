# Scope
The scope of this project is defined by its primary goals and limitations, focusing on the design, implementation, and presentation of Axo as a programming language. Each aspect of the scope establishes the boundaries and practical outcomes of the work.

## Design
The initial phase of the project focuses on designing the Axo programming language. This involves creating a comprehensive blueprint to ensure the language's syntax, semantics, and overall structure align with its intended purpose. A robust design minimizes the need for extensive changes during development, saving time and effort.

## Compiler
To bring the language to life, a compiler is developed. A compiler was chosen over an interpreter to emphasize Axoâ€™s low-level, C-like nature while striving for simplicity and ease of use. The compiler is designed to translate Axo code efficiently into human-readable C code which later gets translated to the target.

## Github
The project will be hosted on a well-organized GitHub repository to facilitate community engagement. The repository will include the source code, build instructions, and automated testing for each supported platform to ensure stability and maintainability.

## Website
In addition to a GitHub repository, the project includes the development of a dedicated website. The website will provide comprehensive documentation and an interactive web-based playground, allowing users to explore the language without the need for local setup. This enhances accessibility and allows for experimentation in scenarios where a computer may not be available.
